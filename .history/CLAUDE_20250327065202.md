Our goal is to create a template with a build script that would would make the following assumptions:
- gh is installed
- gh is logged in
- gh is configured to use the correct GitHub repository
- the main branch is set to deploy to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages

Speed: Quick (2-5 minutes)
Process: Run npm run build, then deploy with gh-pages package
Command: npm install gh-pages && npm run deploy
