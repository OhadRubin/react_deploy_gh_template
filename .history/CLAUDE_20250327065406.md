Our goal is to create a template with a build script that would make the following assumptions:

- gh is installed
- gh is logged in
- npm is installed

It would have a build script that would:

- create a repository on GitHub
- deploy the current react app to GitHub Pages


The template would have the following features:
- use tailwind css
- allow for single serving apps to quickly be created
